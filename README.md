# YOLO Experiment One

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates object detection using YOLOv5m and YOLOv11m model. It includes:

*   Setup of dependencies.
*   Inference on sample a image and a video using YOLOv5m.
*   Inference on sample a image using YOLOv11m.
*   Comparison of YOLOv5m and YOLOv11m, saving results to model_comparison_results.csv.
*   Visualization of comparison metrics (processing time, detections, confidence) saved as plotly plots.
*   Analysis of results using Google Gemini.
*   Annotated video output: driving_annotated.mp4
